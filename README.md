## Sonic Fan Edition Disassembly 
___
Probably my stupidest project, decided to release it after a bit of trolling. May or may not be updated out of boredom or to test my IDA skills. FYI, every other disassembly I have worked on is either incomplete, incredibly boring, or both.

This contains the original non-local label names extracted from the debugger. It is also not bit-perfect whatsoever and can only get past the first two screens without issues.
